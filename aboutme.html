I enjoy writing <strong>useful & reusable software tools</strong> to help others &mdash; check out <a href="/projects">my projects</a>. In the past several years I've become an experienced R useR and an expert in R-Shiny.

I'm addicted to soccer, <strong>travelling</strong> at any given (and non-given) moment, getting into philosophical debates,
and meeting new people :)

The <strong><a href="/projects">projects</a></strong> page is a nice place to see some of my work, but you can also view my (somewhat outdated) <a href="/resume">resume</a>.

<p>I also have <a href="https://deanat78.wordpress.com/">an old blog</a>, mostly from high school and some old travelling trips, that I'll leave here just because I want to have a reference to it somewhere.</p>

  <h1>Help feed me & my coding obsession</h1>
  <p>If you want to show your support for any of the <a href="/projects">open source projects</a> I devote my time to, here's a PayPal one-time Donate button that you may click :) You can also choose to become an official sponsor for my long-term development of open-source projects (sponsoring me comes with some <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/daattali">additional perks for you</a>).</p>

  <p>My open-source projects started as a fun hobby, but as my tools and content got more popular, it has turned into a full-time job commitment (often taking up 20-40 hours per week). Except with 0 pay and no employer benefits :) My goal is to be able to focus as much as I can on <strong>open-source work that benefits the entire community</strong> rather than individual clients, and I can only reach that goal by getting supported for my hard work.</p>
