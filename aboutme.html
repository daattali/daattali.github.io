Grew up in <i>Tel Aviv, Israel</i>, moved to <i>Toronto, Canada</i> during my teens, worked in <i>San Francisco</i> after undergrad, crossed the border again to <i>Vancouver, Canada</i> for grad school, spent many months in other countries backpacking.

<p>I also have <a href="https://deanat78.wordpress.com/">an old blog</a>, mostly from high school and some old travelling trips, that I'll leave here just because I want to have a reference to it somewhere.</p>

  <p>I do spend an immense amount of time developing and constantly improving my R packages, <a href="http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll">Beautiful Jekyll</a>, and my shiny articles, so it would be amazing if some of my hard work translated into some compensation so that I'll be able to shop at fancy Whole Foods once in a while!</p>
